Requires the TV or other device to have a Flingo-enabled application that pulls
the queue call from the Flingo backend.

* Flingo/Automator

  Fling items to the front or back of your queue from your Mac Finder
  simply by right-clicking a file and select "Fling to the front of queue"
  or "Fling to the back of queue".

* Flingo/Desktop

  Fling items from your personal computer's file system to the TV.
  Will serve the file to the TV as long as the Flingo desktop application
  is running.

* Flingo/CommandLine
 
  Fling items from the command-line to the TV.  Will serve the file
  until command-line Flingo is stopped (e.g., ctrl-C). 

* Flingo/WDLXTVRemoteControl

  Adds a web services remote control API to a WD that supports
  JSONP cross-site scripting. 
 

Install
=======

Download flingo.dmg from https://github.com/Flingo/Flingo/downloads
Open flingo.dmg

When presetend with a dialog

  "flingo" is an application downloaded from the Internet.
  Are you sure want to open it?

click open.  When the window opens, move flingo into Applications.


Build from source
-----------------

Obtain the source distribution from the github download page 

  https://github.com/Flingo/Flingo
  
by clicking on "Downloads" on the right-middle of the web page.
A dialog appears and presents options to download source as
a gzipped tar ball (.tar.gz) or a zip file.  Any recent verison of
Windows natively understands .zip files so download the zip file.

Alternatively checkout the latest version using git.

  http://git-scm.com

Once git has been installed, clone the Flingo repository:

  git clone https://github.com/Flingo/Flingo.git

If you wish to build the Flingo desktop application from source, install 
python 2.6 or later.  Install setuptools, which can be obtained from 

  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools


Build from source for MS Windows
--------------------------------

Obtain source code as described in the steps presented in "Build from Source."

Then install py2exe from

  http://www.py2exe.org/      (I installed py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.6.exe)

Then install twisted.

  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/  (I installed Twisted-11.0.0.winxp32-py2.6.msi)

Twisted requires zope.

  easy_install zope.interface  (I installed zope.interface-3.6.1-py2.6-win32.egg)

Install Qt.  I downloaded the windows installer which includes all of
the components to build using Qt including PyQt.

  http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

  (I installed PyQt-Py2.6-x86-gpl-4.8.3-1.exe)

flingo uses netifaces for determining information about network interfaces.

  easy_install netifaces

From the command prompt change into the directory where you downloaded
the Flingo Desktop sources.

  cd Flingo\Desktop
  python setup.py py2exe

py2exe outputs an executable to directory dist\flingo.exe

If py2exe fails because you do not have MSVCM90.DLL then at least as
of this writing, you can install Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express
for free from Microsoft.  In my system the necessary DLLs were
installed in the directory  

  C:\Windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft.vc90.crt_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_9.0.30729.4974_none_50940634bcb759cb\

Once you have the executable, when double-clicked it should run and create 
the fling icon in the systray.  However, the executable is not enough.
We need an installer to create a "flingo" directory in "Program Files,"
to create icons in the "Start Menu."

We uses NSIS to build the installer and uninstaller for MS Windows.  

In Windows I currently have NSIS 2.46 installed which can be obtained from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page

Once NSIS is installed, you can compile the installer by following these
steps:

1. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the directory where you downloaded 
   the Flingo repositroy and then into the Desktop subdirectory.
2. Right-click on the flingo.nsi file and select "Compile NSIS script." 
   This opens a window titled "MakeNSISW" which shows output from the 
   build process.
3. When the build completes, the "close" button ungrays.  Now a file 
   setup.exe should appear in the Flingo/Desktop directory.
4. The resulting setup.exe encapsulates all that is necessary to install 
   or uninstall the desktop version of Flingo. 

NOTE: If I (Dave) run the installer directly from Flingo/Desktop then I get 
an error "Y:\Flingo\Desktop\setup.exe. The specified path does not exist."  
However, if copy the setup.exe onto the desktop and run it then it works.  


Build from source for Mac OS X
------------------------------

In my first attempt to build I used PyQT with Carbon, but when running py2app
I encountered the error:

  ...
  AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'TickCount'

The suggestion at 

  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3461983/evt-tickcount-not-found-with-python2-6-on-osx-10-6-3

is that this is a problem with the Evt module from Carbon.  One of the
suggested solutions is to use a 32-bit only Python from python.org
instead of the Apple-supplied one.  I downloaded Python 2.6.6 from python.org
and replaced the 2.6.1 installed on my system.

I was able to build flingo.org using 32-bit builds.

python 2.6.6
XCode
  xcode_3.2.2_and_iphone_sdk_3.2_final.dmg

Qt SDK
  qt-mac-carbon-opensource-4.7.1.dmg
  http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-mac-carbon-opensource-4.7.1.dmg

SIP
  cd sip-4.11.2/
  python configure.py --arch i386
  make
  sudo make install


PyQt
  cd PyQt-mac-gpl-4.8.1/
  python configure.py --use-arch i386
  make
  sudo make install

twisted
  sudo easy_install twisted

  This installed version 10.1.0.

qt4reactor
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/attachment/ticket/1770/qt4reactor.py

  Put in the directory Flingo/Desktop in the repo.

  I included qt4reactor in the repo for fear that this version might
  disppear given that it isn't part of a versioned distribution but just
  an attachment to a ticket.

py2app

  sudo easy_install py2app

I ran into a couple of problems when building py2app:

   ...
   IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/py2app-0.5.2-py2.6.egg/py2app/apptemplate/prebuilt/main-i386'
 > /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/shutil.py(52)copyfile()
 -> fsrc = open(src, 'rb')
 
I tried to install py2app from source, but I got a new error:
 
   File "/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg/setuptools/package_index.py", line 475, in fetch_distribution
 AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'clone'
 
 Searching on the web shows that this issue was closed 
 
   http://bugs.python.org/setuptools/issue90
 
 But the fix was supposedly in 0.6c12.  So I downloaded the 0.6c12dev version:
 
   setuptools-0.6c12dev_r85334-py2.6.egg
 
I then tried to reinstall py2app which revealed the requirement for 
a newer version of modulegraph:

  error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('modulegraph>=0.8.1')

easy_install modulegraph installed 0.8 which is clearly <0.8.1, so I 
cloned the Mercurial repo 

  hg clone http://bitbucket.org/ronaldoussoren/modulegraph

and installs as 0.8.2.

Now py2app installs.

Switched back to the Flingo repository:  Flingo/Desktop

  python setup.py py2app

This successfully creates dist/flingo.app.  

  cd dist
  open flingo.app

Success!
 
As an aside, I converted Mac flingo.icns to Windows flingo.ico using 
http://iconverticons.com.
